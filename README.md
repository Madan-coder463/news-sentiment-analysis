# News Sentiment Analysis and TTS Application

This application performs **sentiment analysis** and generates **text-to-speech (TTS)** audio in **Hindi** for news articles about a given company. It consists of a **Streamlit frontend** for interacting with users and a **Flask backend** to handle sentiment analysis and TTS generation.

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites:
- **Python**: Version 3.8 or higher.
- **Flask**: For the backend API.
- **Streamlit**: For the frontend.
- **Additional Libraries**: For sentiment analysis, topic extraction, TTS generation, etc.

### Steps to Install and Run the Application:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   First, clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/news-sentiment-analysis.git
   cd news-sentiment-analysis
   ```

2. **Set up a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Required Dependencies**:
   Install the necessary Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Flask API**:
   In the `api.py` directory, start the Flask server:
   ```bash
   python api.py
   ```
   By default, the Flask API runs on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

5. **Run the Streamlit App**:
   In the `app.py` directory, run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

6. **Access the Application**:
   Once the app is running, open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8501` to interact with the frontend.

## Model Details

### 1. **Summarization**:
   The **summarization** of the articles is done using the raw description field from the **Google News RSS Feed**. We also extract detailed content from the article itself using **newspaper3k** for more accurate summaries.

### 2. **Sentiment Analysis**:
   The **sentiment analysis** is performed using the **VADER** (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) model. This model classifies the sentiment of each article as:
   - **Positive**
   - **Negative**
   - **Neutral**

   **VADER** is ideal for analyzing social media and short news articles, which is why it was chosen for this task.

### 3. **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**:
   The **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** is generated using **Google TTS (gTTS)**, which converts the sentiment analysis report into speech in **Hindi**.

   The steps for TTS generation are:
   1. The summaries of all news articles are concatenated.
   2. The concatenated text is translated into **Hindi** using **Google Translate**.
   3. The translated text is converted to audio in **Hindi** using **gTTS**.

## API Development

### 1. **Flask API**:
   The **Flask API** is responsible for:
   - Fetching news articles related to a specific company.
   - Performing **sentiment analysis** on each article.
   - Generating a **TTS audio** file summarizing the sentiment report.
   - Performing **comparative sentiment analysis** to highlight coverage differences.

   The API is accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/fetch_news`.

#### **Flask Routes**:
   - `/fetch_news`: 
     - **Method**: `GET`
     - **Parameters**:
       - `company_name`: The name of the company to search for (e.g., "Tesla").
     - **Response**:
       - `news_data`: A list of articles with their title, summary, sentiment, and topics.
       - `comparative_analysis`: A breakdown of sentiment distribution and coverage differences.
       - `tts_file`: Path to the generated TTS audio file.

   Example:
   ```bash
   curl "http://127.0.0.1:5000/fetch_news?company_name=Tesla"
   ```

### 2. **Postman**:
   You can test the **Flask API** using **Postman**:
   - Set the method to `GET`.
   - URL: `http://127.0.0.1:5000/fetch_news?company_name=Tesla`
   - Hit **Send** to get the JSON response with news articles, sentiment analysis, and TTS file.

## API Usage

### 1. **Third-Party APIs**:
   The project uses the following third-party APIs and libraries:
   - **Google News RSS Feed**: For fetching the latest news articles related to a specific company.
   - **Google Translate** (via **googletrans**): For translating the concatenated article summaries into **Hindi**.
   - **gTTS**: For converting the translated text into **Hindi TTS**.
   - **VADER Sentiment Analysis**: For classifying the sentiment of news articles.

   These APIs are integrated as follows:
   - **Google News RSS**: Fetches the articles in XML format, which is parsed to get the article titles and summaries.
   - **googletrans**: Translates the concatenated summaries of the articles into Hindi.
   - **gTTS**: Converts the Hindi text into speech and saves it as an MP3 file.
   - **VADER**: Classifies the sentiment of the articles into positive, negative, or neutral.

## Assumptions & Limitations

### Assumptions:
1. **Article Availability**: It is assumed that news articles fetched from the **Google News RSS Feed** contain enough content for sentiment analysis and summarization.
2. **Hindi TTS**: It assumes that the **Google TTS** library will work properly with the generated text, especially for non-English languages like **Hindi**.
3. **API Limits**: The application assumes that external APIs like **Google News** and **Google Translate** donâ€™t have significant usage restrictions for this scale.

### Limitations:
1. **Limited Coverage**: The **Google News RSS Feed** might not always contain the latest articles or cover all news sources.
2. **Sentiment Analysis Accuracy**: **VADER** sentiment analysis works well for social media and shorter texts but might not be perfect for all types of news articles.
3. **Text-to-Speech Quality**: The generated TTS may not have the best **pronunciation** in **Hindi**, and **gTTS** may have limitations in how it handles long texts.
4. **API Rate Limiting**: Some external APIs, like **Google Translate**, may have rate limits that could affect performance if too many requests are made in a short time.

### Conclusion

This project integrates **news sentiment analysis**, **comparative sentiment analysis**, and **Hindi TTS generation** into a seamless web application. By using **Streamlit** for the frontend and **Flask** for the backend, it provides an interactive way to explore news articles, analyze sentiment, and generate a TTS report in **Hindi**.

### **GitHub Description**:
This repository contains a **News Sentiment Analysis** application built with **Streamlit** and **Flask**. It fetches news articles for a specified company, performs **sentiment analysis**, and generates a **Hindi TTS** report summarizing the findings. The project also includes a **comparative sentiment analysis** feature that compares the sentiment between different articles and highlights coverage differences.
